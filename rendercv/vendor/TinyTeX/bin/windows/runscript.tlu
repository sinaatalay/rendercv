  Script wrappers in TeX Live on Windows
  
  Rationale
  
    Wrappers enable use of scripts on Windows as regular programs.  
    They are also required for some binary programs to set up the 
    right environment for them. 
    
    Batch scripts can be used for wrapping but they are not as universal 
    as binaries (there are some odd cases where they don't work) and 
    it is hard to make them robust and secure.  Compiled binary wrappers 
    don't suffer from these problems but they are harder to write, debug
    and maintain in comparison to scripts.  For these reasons a hybrid 
    approach is taken that combines a binary stub with a launcher script.
  
  Adding wrappers for user scripts
  
    The script wrapping machinery is not limited to scripts shipped with 
    TeX Live.  You can also use it for script programs from manually 
    installed packages.  This should minimize problems when using them 
    with TeX Live. 
    
    First, make sure that there is an interpreter program available
    on your system for the script you want to use.  Interpreters for
    Perl, Lua and Tcl/Tk (GUI scripts only) are bundled with TeX
    Live, all others have to be installed independently.  Lua
    scripts are the most efficient to run, so if you consider
    writing a new script, that would be the recommended choice.
    
    The following script types and their file extensions are currently 
    supported and searched in that order:
    
      Lua      (.tlu;.texlua;.lua) --  included
      Perl     (.pl)               --  included
      Ruby     (.rb)               --  requires installation
      Python   (.py)               --  requires installation
      Tcl      (.tcl)              --  included (GUI scripts only)
      Java     (.jar)              --  requires installation
      VBScript (.vbs)              --  part of Windows
      JScript  (.js)               --  part of Windows
      Batch    (.bat;.cmd)         --  part of Windows
    
    Finally, Unix-style extensionless scripts are searched as last and 
    the interpreter program is established based on the she-bang (#!) 
    specification on the very first line of the script.  This can be 
    an arbitrary program but it must be present on the search path.
    
    Next, the script program needs to be installed somewhere below the 
    'scripts' directory under one of the TEXMF trees (consult the 
    documentation or texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf file for a list).  You may 
    need to update the file search database afterwards with:
    
      mktexlsr [TEXMFDIR]
      
    It is also possible to use scripts that are outside of TEXMF hierarchy 
    by adjusting TEXMFSCRIPTS environment or kpathsea variable, see 
    kpathsea documentation for more information on setting its variables.
    
    Test if the script can be located with:
    
      kpsewhich --format=texmfscripts <script-name>.<ext>
    
    This should output the full path to the script if everything is 
    properly installed and configured.  If this test is successful, 
    the script can be run immediately with:
    
      runscript <script-name> [script arguments]
    
    If you prefer to call the script program simply by its name, copy 
    and rename bin/windows/runscript.exe (or bin/win64/runscript.exe for
    64-bit Windows) to <script-name>.exe and put it somewhere on the
    search path.]]

  Wrapper structure
  
    Wrappers consist of small binary stubs and a common texlua script.  
    The binary stubs are all the same, just different names (but CLI 
    and GUI stubs differ, see below, and GUI stubs are actually all 
    different due to different embedded icons).
    
    The job of the binary stub is twofold: (a) call the texlua launcher
    script 'runscript.tlu' from the same directory (or more precisely 
    from the directory containing 'runscript.dll') and (b) pass to it 
    argv[0] and the unparsed argument string as the last two arguments 
    (after adding a sentinel argument, which ends with a new line 
    character).  Arbitrary C strings can be passed, because the script 
    is executed by linking with luatex.dll and calling the lua 
    interpreter internally rather than by spawning a new process.
    
    There are two flavours of the binary stub: one for CLI programs 
    and another one for GUI programs.  The GUI variant does not open 
    a console window nor does it block the command prompt if started 
    from there.  It also uses a dialog box to display an error message 
    in addition to outputting to stderr.
    
    The stubs are further split into a common DLL and EXE proxies 
    to it.  This is for maintenance reasons - updates can be done by 
    replacement of a single DLL rather than all binary stubs.
    
    The launcher script knows, which variant has been used to invoke it 
    based on the sentinel argument.  The lack of this argument means 
    that it was invoked in a standard way, i.e., through texlua.exe. 
    
    All the hard work of locating a script/program to execute happens 
    in the launcher script.  The located script/program is always 
    executed directly by spawning its interpreter (or binary) in a new 
    process.  The system shell (cmd.exe) is never called (except for 
    batch scripts, of course).  If the located script happens to be 
    a (tex)lua script, it is loaded and called internally from within 
    this script, i.e. no new process is spawned.  Execution is done 
    using a protected call, so any compile or runtime errors are caught.
    
  Source files
  
    runscript.tlu     launcher script for locating and dispatching 
                      target scripts/programs
    runscript_dll.c   common DLL part of the binary stubs; locates and
                      calls the launcher script
    runscript_exe.c   EXE proxy to the common DLL for CLI mode stubs
    wrunscript_exe.c  EXE proxy to the common DLL for GUI mode stubs
  
  Compilation of binaries (requires luatex.dll in the same directory)

    with gcc (size optimized):
    
    gcc -Os -s -shared -o runscript.dll runscript_dll.c -L./ -lluatex
    gcc -Os -s -o runscript.exe runscript_exe.c -L./ -lrunscript
    gcc -mwindows -Os -s -o wrunscript.exe wrunscript_exe.c -L./ -lrunscript

    with tcc (extra small size):
    
    tiny_impdef luatex.dll
    tcc -shared -o runscript.dll runscript_dll.c luatex.def
    tcc -o runscript.exe runscript_exe.c runscript.def
    tcc -o wrunscript.exe wrunscript_exe.c runscript.def

OVERVIEW OF MAIN_CHUNK

We start out with a lot of housekeeping, especially with respect to
perl and ghostscript: if we are going to use the built-in versions,
then the search path and other environment variables must be set or
unset to make these findable and working right.

Next we compose an ARGV table for os.spawn, unless the script turns
out to be a [tex]lua script; see further down this comment block.

The parameter table ARGV can have the following elements (see the
luatex manual on os.exec and os.spawn):

- ARGV[0]: the full path to the interpreter
- ARGV[1]: the filename part of the interpreter. The interpreter choice
  depends on the detected script extension and also on gui mode.
- ARGV[2]: progfulname, the full path to the script
- ARGV[3]: argline, i.e. the unparsed arguments for the script.
  This is normally the last argument passed to runscript.tlu.
  See the actual code for when this is not the case.

ARGV[0] gets priority over ARGV[1] if it is present.

After everything has been set up, a call os.spawn(ARGV) runs the
right program with the right arguments.

But in case the script to be run is a texlua script, we run the script
in the current texlua process using the dofile function. The original arg
argument table may have been modified before then.

Some variables:

- ARGV, see above
- arg, the texlua argument table of runscript.tlu
- progname, the name under which [w]runscript.exe was called
- progfullname, the full path of the script to be run. This variable
  is introduced only after some special cases have been dealt with.
- argline, unparsed arguments to the script; may get modified
