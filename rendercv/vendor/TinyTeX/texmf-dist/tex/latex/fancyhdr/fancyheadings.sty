  fancyhdr is 99 percent compatible with\MessageBreak
  fancyheadings. The only incompatibility is\MessageBreak
  that \protect\headrulewidth\space and \protect\footrulewidth\space
     and\MessageBreak
  their \protect\plain... versions are no longer length\MessageBreak
  parameters, but normal macros (to be changed\MessageBreak
