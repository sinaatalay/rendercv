%% This package was invented by Jeffrey P. Goldberg.
%% I thought that a replacement was needed and therefore created the pageslts package,
%% https://ctan.org/pkg/pageslts
%% . Nevertheless, for compatibility with existing documents/packages as well as for
%% the low amount of resources needed by the lastpage package (no new counter!),
%% I updated this package.
%% Thanks go to Jeffrey P. Goldberg for allowing me to do this.
%% 
%% While this package allows for things like "Page slash thepage{} of slash pageref{LastPage}"
%% to get "Page 7 of 9" or "Page VII of IX",
%% the NUMBER of pages is nowadays available via slash @abspage@last from the kernel,
%% but with pages for example I to X and then 1 to 10, the number of pages would be "20",
%% while the name of the last page is "10". Decide what you need/want!
%% 
%% This work consists of the main source file lastpage.dtx,
%% the README, and the derived files
%%    lastpage.sty, lastpage209.sty, lastpage2e.sty,
%%    lastpageclassic.sty, lastpagemodern.sty,
