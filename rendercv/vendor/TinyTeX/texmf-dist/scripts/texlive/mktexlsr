usage="Usage: $progname [OPTION]... [DIR]...

Rebuild ls-R filename databases used by TeX.  If one or more arguments
DIRS are given, these are used as the directories in which to build
ls-R. Else all directories in the search path for ls-R files
(\$TEXMFDBS) are used.

Options:
  --dry-run  do not actually update anything
  --help     display this help and exit 
  --quiet    cancel --verbose
  --silent   same as --quiet
  --verbose  explain what is being done
  --version  output version information and exit
  
If standard input is a terminal, --verbose is on by default.

For more information, see the \`Filename database' section of
Kpathsea manual available at http://tug.org/kpathsea.

# The simple PATH-prepending approach we take in other scripts doesn't
