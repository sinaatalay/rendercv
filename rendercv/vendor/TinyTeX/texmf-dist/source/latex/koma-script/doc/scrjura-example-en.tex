\addsec{Preamble}

The club landscape in England is diverse. But we have
unfortunately been forced to conclude that it often
suffers seriously when dealing with seriousness.

\appendix

\section{Overview}

\begin{contract}
\Clause{title={Name, Legal Form, Headquarters}}

The name of this club shall be the ``Club for Club
Hoppers'' and is not registered in any club register.

'S The club is a non-economic, useless club'. It has no
headquarters because its members heads are in their
hindquarters.

The fiscal year is from March 31st through April 1st.

\Clause{title={Purpose of the Club}}

'S The club is pointless but not useless'. Rather,
it should put the serious handling of seriousness on a
sound footing.

For this purpose, the club members can
\begin{enumerate}[\qquad a)]
\item pick their noses,
\item crack nuts,
\item such their thumbs.
\end{enumerate}

The club is selfish and stands by it.

The club has no financial means.\label{a:mittel}

\Clause{title={Club Officers}}

The club officers hold honorary positions.

'S If the club had resources (see \ref{a:mittel}), it
could afford a full-time manager'. Without the necessary
funds, this is not possible.

\Clause{title={Club Hopper},dummy}
\label{p.maier}
\end{contract}

\section{Membership}

\begin{contract}
\Clause{title={Types of Members},dummy}

\Clause{title={Becoming a Member}}

Everyone can purchase a membership from one of the
associations listed in \refClause{p.maier}.\label{a.preis}

'S To become a member, an informal application is
required'. This application should be submitted in green
ink on pink paper.

Membership applications cannot be rejected.

\SubClause{title={Amendment to the Previous Clause}}

'S With the repeal of \refClause{p.maier},
\ref{a.preis} has become impractical'. In its place,
memberships can be inherited.

\Clause{title={Termination of Membership}}

'S Membership ends with one's life'. For non-living
members, membership does not end.

\Clause{title={General Meeting}}

A general meeting shall take place twice per year.

The interval between two general meetings shall be
no more than 6~months, 1~week, and 2~days.

The invitation to the next general meeting shall be sent
no earlier than 6~months from the previous general
meeting.

\SubClause{title={Amendment to the General Meeting}}

The general meeting may be held at the earliest 2~weeks after
the invitation is received.
\end{contract}

\Clause{title={Effective Date}}

These articles will enter into force on 11.\,11.\,2011 at

'S If any provision of these by-laws is in conflict with
any other, the by-laws will be repealed on
11.\,11.\,2011 at 11:11~am and 11~seconds'. The club is
considered to be dissolved in this case.
