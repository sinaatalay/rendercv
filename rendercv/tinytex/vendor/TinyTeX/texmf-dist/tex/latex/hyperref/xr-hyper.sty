%% xr-hyper package (beta release)

%% Copyright (C) 1993-2023 David Carlisle

%% This is a modified version of the xr package from the Standard LaTeX
%% tools distribution. It has some internal changes to cooperate with
%% the hyperref package, and one new user level argument, also mainly of
%% use for hyperref.
%% If no problems are reported the version in the tools distribution
%% will be updated to match this at the next LaTeX release.

%% \externaldocument[prefix][nocite]{document}[URL]

%% The `document' referred to by the main argument is the file
%% document.aux
%% which must be somewhere on TeX's input path.
%% Some packages (eg hyperref) really need to know the location of the
%% final document rather than the aux file. By default this is assumed
%% to be `document.pdf'. A package may redefine the command \XR@ext to
%% change this default extension. However sometimes the final
%% document may be in a position unrelated to the aux file, or the
%% browser may not be able to find files at an arbitrary point in
%% TeX's input path, so the new final optional argument allows a full
%% URL to the final document to be specified.
%%
%% \externaldocument{file}[http://here.xxx.edu/this/path/to/file.pdf]
%%
%% Version beta2 also added another improvement unrelated
%% to the hyperref support. Olivier Michel pointed out that
%% if the aux file was not on texinputs you could not always go
%% \externaldocument{/some/path/to/file}
%% specifically that worked if file.aux was a `simple'  document with
%% one aux file, but if \include had been used, the `sub' aux files
%% would not be found by xr in the remote directory.
%% This version calls \filename@parse to get the directory name of the
%% remote directory, which is then explicitly prepended to the names of
%% any included aux files.
%%
%%
%% Version 6.1 incorporates linking to citations in external documents
%% (originally from xcite package and now included in xr.
%%
%% Many packages have variant citation commands (natbib,
%% biblatex,....) and the external document may or may not have used
%% hyperref. Because of these differences the citation linking may not
%% always work, it can be disabled by specifying [nocite] after the
%% prefix:
%%
%%  \externaldocument[][nocite]{somefile}
%%
%% In the case of \ref, if the external document has not used
%% hyperref, this package will work like xr and produce the correct
%% text, but can not produce a well formed link as the target document
%% is not set up. In this case you may prefer to use \ref* rather than
%% \ref to avoid generating a hyperlink.

%% History
%%
%% 1997/10/06 v6.00 beta2
%%
%% 1999/09/01 v6.00 beta3
%%   Definitions of \XR@addURL corrected (Heiko Oberdiek).
%%
%% 2000/03/22 v6.00 beta4
%%   \xdef changed to \protected@xdef.
%%
%% 2019/10/03 v6.1
%%   Incorporate updates to xr (including citation support)
%%
%% 2020-05-14 v7.00e
%%   add additional braces to \r@ only if hyperref is not detected in the aux
%%   of the source document (https://github.com/latex3/hyperref/issues/118)
%% 
%% 2023-05-15 v.7.00z
%%  unified and simplified the brace handling: all defined references have now
%%  five brace groups. Together with the planed change in LaTeX 2023-06-01 this
%%  will improve the combination of hyperref/non-hyperref documents.
